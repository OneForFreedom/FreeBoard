Basically this keyboard is a 60% uk iso keyboard (yes the one with the big upside down L)

The main keys are self explanatory.
The first rotary encoder (going from left) Does volumne control, twist it to adjust vol, and press it to mute/unmute it.
Second is for seeking tracks and pausing and playing, and 
third is null (idk what to do yet)
