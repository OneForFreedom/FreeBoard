# June 29-30th: Started the build!

[I made a schematic today and completed footprints. I also researched parts. I'm using a raspberry pi pico, which is like 5 us dollars, I also found switches which are 110 for 60ish dollars, I know its a bit steep, but I can't afford getting super bad low quality ones after a month of waiting. I also found.. Well, nothing, I was looking for keycaps but realised that you can't get good ones for 10 dollars. I'll have to save the search for keycaps later. I'm gonna have to look for two rotary encoders and 62 diodes.
Peace!]
